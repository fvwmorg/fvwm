.SH NAME
FvwmCommand \- fvwm command external interface

.SH SYNOPSIS
FvwmCommand [-cmrvw] [-S name] [-i level] [-f name] [-F level] [command...]

.SH DESCRIPTION

FvwmCommand lets you monitor fvwm transaction and issue fvwm command
from a shell command line or scripts.
FvwmCommand takes each argument as a fvwm command. Quotes can be
used to send commands including spaces.
.EX
FvwmCommand 'FvwmPager 0 1'
.EE
.br
.SH INVOCATION
FvwmCommandS should be spawned once by fvwm, either in .fvwm2rc file,
from menu, or from FvwmConsole.
From then on, FvwmCommand
can be called from a shell or script to execute fvwm commands.

From within .fvwm2rc file:
.EX
Module FvwmCommandS

    or

AddToFunc StartFunction "I" Module FvwmCommandS
.EE

Then, in script file or from shell:

.EX
FvwmCommand  'popup Utilities'
.EE

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fI-c\fR" 0.4i
Informs FvwmCommand to read multiple commands from the standard input
instead of the one command specified in the command line arguments.
This disables \fI-m\fR or \fI-i\fR.
.sp
.EX
(echo "Exec xload"; echo "Beep") | FvwmCommand -c
.EE

.IP "\fI-F <level>\fR" 0.4i
Specifies the level of fvwm window flags FvwmCommand outputs.
.sp
.RS
.IP 0 0.4i
No window flags will be printed.
.RE
.RS
.IP 2 0.4i
Full window flags will be printed if information level, -i
option, is 2 or 3.
.sp
.RE

.IP "\fI-f <name>\fR" 0.4i
Specifies an alternative FIFO set to communicate with a server.
The default FIFO set is /var/tmp/FvwmCommand-${DISPLAY}C, in which
FvwmCommand..C is used to send commands and FvwmCommand..M is to receive
messages. If that path is unusable ${FVWM_USERDIR}/FvwmCommand-${DISPLAY}
will be used instead.
FvwmCommandS must have been invoked with the same <name> as its first argument
prior to FvwmCommand invocation.
Alternatively, option -S can be used. Refer option -S.
This option -f is useful when a dedicated connection is necessary
to run a background job while another connection is kept for
interactive use.

.IP "\fI-i <level>\fR"
Specifies the level of information that FvwmCommand outputs.
.sp
.RS
.IP 0 0.4i
Error messages only.
.EX
FvwmCommand -i0 FvwmBanner
.EE
will show a banner without any output. On the other hand,
.EX
FvwmCommand -i 0 foobar
.EE
will return,
.EX
[fvwm][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module
\&'foobar' in ModulePath '/usr/lib/X11/fvwm'
.EE

Note that Fvwm doesn't return any error messages in
cases like below since 'windowid' itself is a valid command.
.sp
.EX
FvwmCommand -i 0 'windowid foo bar'
.EE
.IP 1
Errors, replies and window configuration information. This is the default.
.EX
FvwmCommand send_windowlist
.EE
Information like below will show up.
.EX

.EE
The first column shows the window ID number, which can be used in 'windowid' command.
The second column shows the information types.
The last column shows the information contents.
If no information is returned, add -w <time> or -r option.
This might be needed in heavily loaded systems.

All information available.

.RE

.IP "\fI-m\fR"
Monitors fvwm window information transaction. FvwmCommand continuously outputs
information that it receives without exiting.
This option can be used in a
background job often combined with -i3 option in order to control windows
dynamically.
.EX
FvwmCommand -mi3 | grep 'iconify'
.EE
It will report when windows are iconified or de-iconified.
.sp
Note: FvwmCommand does not block buffer its output but many utilities such as
grep or sed use block buffer. The output of the next example will not show up
until either FvwmCommand is terminated or stdout buffer from
grep is filled.
.EX
FvwmCommand -mi3 | grep ' map' |
sed 's/\\(0x[0-9a-f]*\\).*/windowid \\1 move 0 0/'
.EE
Instead, use tools with buffer control such as pty or perl.
The below will iconify new windows when opened.
.EX
Fvwm -mi3 | perl -ne '
$|=1;
print "windowid $1 iconify\\n" if /^(0x\\S+) add/;
\&' > ~/\.FvwmCommandC
.EE
.IP "\fI-r\fR"
Waits for a reply before it exits.
FvwmCommand exits if no information or error is returned in a fixed amount of
time period. (Refer option -w.)
The option -r overrides this time limit and wait for at least one message
back.
After the initial message, it will wait for another message for the time
limit.
This option is useful when the system is too loaded to make any prediction
when the system is responding AND the command causes some
message to be sent back.

.IP "\fI-S <name>\fR" 0.4i
Invokes another server, FvwmCommandS, with FIFO set <name>.
.br
If -f option is not used with this option,
the invoking FvwmCommand uses the default FIFO to communicate
the default server to invoke a new server.
.br
If -f option is used with this option,
the invoking FvwmCommand uses the default FIFO to communicate
the default server to invoke a new server. Then, switch the FIFO
set and start communicating the new server.
.br
This option -S is useful when a dedicated connection is necessary
to run a background
job while another connection is kept for interactive use.

If the <name> is a relative path name, that is relative from where
fvwm is running, not from where FvwmCommand is invoked.

.IP "\fI-v\fR"
Returns FvwmCommand version number and exits.

.IP "\fI-w <time>\fR"
Waits for <time> micro seconds for a message.
FvwmCommand exits if no information or error is returned in a fixed amount of
time period unless option -m is used.
The default is 500 ms. This option overrides this default value.

.SH WRAPPER
.sp
.sp
FvwmCommand.sh has bourne shell function definitions
to keep the syntax similar to fvwm configuration file.
This file is to be sourced:
.EX
\&. FvwmCommand.sh
.br
DesktopSize 5x5
.EE
.br
FvwmCommand.pm is for perl in order
to keep the syntax similar to fvwm configuration file.
Commas can be used to separate fvwm commands' arguments.
.EX
use FvwmCommand;
if( $ARGV[0] eq 'home' ) {
    Desk 0,0; GotoPage '1 1';
}elsif( $ARGV[0] eq 'jump' ) {
    Desk "0 2"; GotoPage 0, 1;
}
.EE
Although arguments in FvwmCommand are not case sensitive as fvwm,
the functions defined in FvwmCommand.sh and FvwmCommand.pl are case sensitive.


.SH ERRORS
If the following error message show up, it is most likely that FvwmCommandS
is not running.
.EX
FvwmCommand error in opening message fifo
--No such file or directory--
.EE
Fvwm modules don't return error messages to fvwm but output on
stderr. These error messages will not be shown as FvwmCommand messages.

FvwmCommand is an interface to send commands to and receive
information from Fvwm2 from processes which are not Fvwm modules.


.SH EXAMPLES
  test1.pl      - takes 1 argument  't' to invoke FvwmTalk
                                    'td'  to kill FvwmTalk
                                    ''  to move windows
  test2.sh      - takes 1 argument  'b'  to invoke FvwmButtons
                                    'kb' to kill FvwmButtons
                                    'r'  to change # of button rows
                                    'c'  to change # of button columns
  ex-auto.pl    - auto raise small windows. It will keep them visible.
  ex-cascade.pl - cascade windows, then move them back.
  ex-grpmv.pl   - choose a group of windows to move together.

  Above examples are not meant to be practical but to show how it can
  be done.



  focus-link.pl
     This is a user programmable window focus script.
     Default behavior is:
      1. When a window is opened up, focus the window and move the pointer
         to it. The parent window regains focus when a window is closed.
         Parenthood is determined when a window is opened. It is the last
         focused window with the same X class.
      2. #1 would not occur to AcroRead opening window.
      3. #1 would not occur when SkipMapping is set and the window is the
         only window of its class.
      4. For Netscape find dialog window, addition to #1, resize the window
         to 300x150 pixels and move it to East edge of the screen.
         Download/upload windows will not be focused nor be in focus link
         list.
      5. Move appletviewer to NorthWest corner.
      6. Xterm won't focus back to its parent after closed.
      7. When a window is de-iconified, focus it and move the pointer.

  focus-Netscape.pl
      Focuses pop-up windows, such as 'open URL' or 'find' whenever
      opened up. This let the user to type in immediately without
      moving mouse. This script also moves 'download' window to the
      right edge to keep it visible. If this is invoked from
      .fvwm2rc, use as:

          AddToFunc "StartFunction" "I" Module  FvwmCommandS
          + "I" Exec $HOME/scripts/focus-Netscape.pl

  push-away.pl <direction> <window name>
      Pushes windows away to avoid overlapping. use as:

          push-away.pl up 'Fvwm Pager'
