.SH DESCRIPTION
FvwmConsoleC.pl offers editing capabilities  while  the  user  is
entering  the line.  By default, the line editing commands
are similar to those of emacs. It also offers
.B substitution
, which replaces a pattern to a string before it sends the command.

.SH FUNCTIONS

.RE

.SH CONFIGURATION
The key binding can be overridden or defined
in fvwm module configuration.

.RS
*FvwmConsole: Key \\ck prev_line
.RE

Non-space character sequence need not be quoted.
In order to undefine, omit the last argument.

.RS
*FvwmConsole: Key \\ck
.RE

Note that non-meta character is case sensitive.
\\c means control key, \\e means escape, and \\m is alt key.
.br
It also accepts Subst configuration. Users often input long fvwm command
repeatedly. Subst will replace particular input sequence to user defined
string. Example:

.RS
*FvwmConsole: Subst '^bigx' 'Exec xterm -g 120x60+0+0 -fn 10x20 -fg black -bg lemonchiffon'
.RE

Typing 'bigx<return>' in FvwmConsole will launch xterm. '^' denotes
the beginning of line in
.B regular expression.
\&'pl' in the middle
of the command will not be replaced. Although the format looks different,
it takes Perl regular expression.
It just uses single or double quote as the delimiter.
Single or double quotes have no difference, although they have to match,
and cannot include itself in the string.

.RS
*FvwmConsole: Subst '^g\\s*(\\d+)' 'Desk 0 0\\nGotoPage 0 $1\\nFocus'
.RE

Entering 'g4' or 'g  4' will jump to desk 0 page 0 4 and focus.

.SH INVOCATION
FvwmConsoleC.pl should be invoked by FvwmConsole.
