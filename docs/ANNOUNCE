fvwm-2.4.19 maintenance release for all earlier 2.4.x versions.
It contains a number of minor fixes.

This release is available at the home page: http://www.fvwm.org/.

Who needs to upgrade?
---------------------

Because of the security issues with fvwm-2.3.4 to fvwm-2.4.17, it
is strongly recommended to upgrade from fvwm-2.4.17 or
earlier. Upgrading from 2.4.18 is optional.

System administrators are encouraged to install this version to
grant their users access to the latest stable version.

Bug Fixes:
----------

* Fixed BackingStore style option.

* Fixed MoveToDesk commend with a single argument.

* Allow whitespace in menu names.

* Fixed a hang when restarting FvwmCommand or FvwmConsole.

* A double click no longer occurs when two different mouse
  buttons are pressed.

* Fixed a relief drawing problem in FvwmWinList.

* Fixed traveling windows on restart if a window used non NorthWest
  gravity and changed that before the restart.

* Fixed installation of FvwmGtk.1 for debian (with DESTDIR set).

* The clock in FvwmTaskBar is redrawn immediately when its colour
  changes.

* The option CurrentGlobalPageAnyDesk was accidentally named
  CurrentGlobbalPageAnyDesk before.

* Fixed a problem with fvwm startup and shutdown when the pointer
  was grabbed by another application.
