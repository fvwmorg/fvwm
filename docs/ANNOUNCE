modules.

depending on wether they see one of the problems described below.
Users of 2.4.10, 2.4.11, 2.4.12 or 2.4.13 are highly encouraged to
upgrade.  Users of 2.4.9 and below are recommended to upgrade.
System administrators are higly encouraged to upgrade from 2.4.13
or below.

Bug Fixes:
----------

* Fix for gmplayer launched by fvwm.  Close stdin on Exec so the
  exec'd process knows its not running interactively.

* Windows using the WindowListSkip style do not appear in the
  FvwmTaskBar at random.

* Fixed a memory leak in ChangeIcon, ChangeForeColor and
  ChangeBackColor FvwmScript Instruction.

* Fixed a core dump in the parsing of FvwmAuto arguments.

* Fixed screwed calculation of icon picture size when application
  specifies it explicitly.

* The option ShowOnlyIcons now works as described in the
  FvwmIconMan man page.  It was accidentally named ShowOnlyIconic
  before.
